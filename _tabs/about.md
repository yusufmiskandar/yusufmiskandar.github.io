# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm Yusuf M. Iskandar, an ordinary man who is passionate about the Outdoors Activity, Technology, and Homelabs. I am very interested in Linux, Spreadsheets, and various aspects of technology that can help improve the quality of life. Currently, I am focusing on personal development through learning about technology and the outdoors. I believe that by combining these two interests, we can create innovative solutions that can help society. I am also interest in various workflows in the fields of economics, management and accounting.
